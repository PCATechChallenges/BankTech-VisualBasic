    ' ## Extra challenges ##
    ' 1. What would you do to enable this to output wordcounts by each set of links followed?
    ' 2. The word count currently takes ALL text from an html file. What would you do to to only focus on the visible on-page text?
    ' 3. The URL handling currently needs full http:// addresses to follow links. How could you do this differently to make it more robust?

    ' DISCLAIMER: Remember, not all sites like to be scraped by robots. In some places it's probably even illegal. 
    ' ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE SITE OWNER'S PERMISSION BEFORE GOING OUT AND SCRAPING STUFF!!
